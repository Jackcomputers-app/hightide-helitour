# Aerial Photography 101: How to Capture Stunning Shots from the Sky

Whether you're an amateur photographer, a seasoned content creator, or just someone with a smartphone and a love for jaw-dropping views, there's nothing quite like the thrill of capturing the coast from above. At **High Tide Aviation**, our [aerial photography flights](https://flyhightide.com/packages/aerial-photography) give you access to some of the most scenic and dramatic landscapes along the Southeast shoreline‚Äîviewed from a helicopter or airplane at just the right altitude.

But how do you make the most of that brief window in the sky? Whether you're shooting over **Southport, NC**, or **St. Simons Island, GA**, we‚Äôve gathered expert tips from our pilots and photography guests so you can turn your aerial tour into a gallery-worthy collection of coastal memories.

## 1. Choose the Right Tour for the Right Shot

Not all tours are created equal‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre aiming for professional or social-worthy photography. If you have a specific subject in mind (real estate, landscape, wildlife, or lighthouses), you‚Äôll want a tour tailored to those needs.

‚úÖ **Solution:** Book a [custom aerial photography flight](https://flyhightide.com/packages/aerial-photography) or build your own route with one of our [custom tour options](https://flyhightide.com/packages/custom-tours), available in both [Southport](https://flyhightide.com/southport/custom-tour-southport) and [St. Simons Island](https://flyhightide.com/st-simons-island/custom-tour-st-simons).

## 2. Use a Fast Shutter Speed

When you're flying at 80‚Äì120 knots, even the slightest movement can introduce motion blur. That means your usual landscape settings might not cut it from the air.

üì∏ **Pro tip:** Use **shutter priority mode (Tv or S)** and set your speed to at least **1/1000th of a second**. This will freeze motion and reduce the chance of blurred images from aircraft vibration or movement.

---

## 3. Avoid Reflections‚ÄîIf You Can

Windows in aircraft can introduce unwanted reflections or glare that can ruin your shot. If you're in a closed-door aircraft, there are a few tricks to help minimize this.

üí° **Try this:**

- Wear dark clothing to avoid casting reflections.
- Hold your lens close to the glass without touching it.
- Use a rubber lens hood if available‚Äîit blocks side glare and lets you press gently against the window.

üõ©Ô∏è Want the best view? Ask about **open-door or low-wing options** on our [custom tours](https://flyhightide.com/packages/custom-tours)‚Äîideal for photographers.

## 4. Focus on Patterns and Contrast

From above, the landscape transforms into a patchwork of light, color, and symmetry. The key to stunning aerial photography often lies in **finding patterns**‚Äîlike winding rivers, marshland channels, or clustered rooftops.

üåä **Things to look for:**

- The curves of Cape Fear‚Äôs barrier islands
- The spiral of a lighthouse stairwell
- The sunset shadows over tidal creeks
- Boats cutting through the surf leaving white wakes

These abstract, geometric, or high-contrast compositions work especially well on Instagram or in landscape portfolios.

## 5. Bring the Right Gear (But Keep It Simple)

You don‚Äôt need thousands of dollars in lenses to take stunning aerial shots. In fact, simplicity often works better when you're strapped in, wearing a headset, and navigating changing light.

üéí **Suggested gear:**

- DSLR or mirrorless camera with **24‚Äì70mm** or **70‚Äì200mm** lens
- Smartphone with a high-res camera and image stabilization
- Polarizing filter (optional) to cut through haze and water glare
- Extra memory cards and a full battery‚Äîalways

## 6. Timing Is Everything

Golden hour isn‚Äôt just for engagement shoots. The **hour after sunrise or before sunset** offers the best light for aerial photography‚Äîsoft, warm, and dramatic.

üåÖ Want to capture the magic? Consider one of our [sunset custom tours](https://flyhightide.com/packages/custom-tours) for unbeatable lighting, especially along the dunes of Oak Island or the marshes near Jekyll.

## 7. Communicate with Your Pilot

One of the biggest advantages of flying with High Tide is the **direct connection between pilot and passenger**. Tell us what you‚Äôre hoping to photograph, and our experienced pilots will position the aircraft, adjust altitude, or circle key areas to get you the perfect shot.

üéß **Pro tip:** Use your headset to request re-angles or linger over a particular view‚Äîespecially on [private or custom photography tours](https://flyhightide.com/packages/aerial-photography).
