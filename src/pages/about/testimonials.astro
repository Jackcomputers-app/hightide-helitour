Our pilot, Paige, was super friendly, explained everything as it was happening, and gave me an AMAZING experience by letting me take part in controlling some of the flight - definitely recommend the Discovery add-on! I'd love to do this again if I visit the area in the future, and will be talking it up to family and friends!`,

Justin was our pilot and he was very sweet and knowledgeable. We did the Bald Head Island tour which was about 20 minutes- Justin told us everything about the island and surrounding areas which was cool. The flight was very smooth and comfortable as well. I would love to do this again. Thank you Justin!`,

It was so much fun. The pilot was awesome! He explained everything to us and told us what to expect. He also pointed out things around the area which was great! We have decided to go back and do it again when we go back to Oak Island on our next beach trip.`,
